Refactor the AdvertisementService

Goal: 
- The current implementation works, but the quality of the implementation/code is very poor.
- Find the problems, refactor it, make it better.
- Use TDD, SOLID principles, Clean Code, etc.
- We don't expect the new code to run, we would like to see how you approach refactoring, what are your thoughts about it. 

Requirements:
- The AdvertisementService must have a "public Advertisement GetAdvertisement(string id)" method -> This is the "Entry Point"
- Modification of the ThirdParty project is not allowed (it's third party we must use it as it is)
- Any other modifications like new classes, methods, tests, etc are welcome if/as required
